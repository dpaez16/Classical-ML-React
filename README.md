# Classical-ML-React
This is a React application that uses D3.js to visualize several classical machine learning algorithms. 
All visualizations are computed through a Flask backend server. 
Each page has a "Background" section (on the bottom) if you wish to learn more about the algorithm itself.  
  
To run locally:
  - Download the repo.
  - Run the back-end server.
  - Run the front-end app.
  
Instructions for running both the front-end and back-end are in README files within each respective directory.
